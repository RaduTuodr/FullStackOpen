# FullStackOpen Course Repository

This repository contains my work from the **FullStackOpen** course by the University of Helsinki. Throughout this course, I explored various modern web development technologies. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of what you can find in this repo:

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- **React**: For building user interfaces with a component-based approach.
- **Redux**: To manage the application state efficiently and enable seamless data flow.
- **Node.js**: To create a robust server-side environment for my applications.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing data in a flexible format (connection done using mongoose package).
- **GraphQL**: To provide a powerful and efficient API for data querying.
- **CI/CD**: principles to automate testing and deployment processes.
